# FinalYearProject
The file FYPDocument.pdf contains all the documentation for the project. The project consisted of a statistical analysis of athlete data and a data visualisation tool (written in shiny, an R library) that was capable of taking athlete data in a certain format and displaying graphs and charts relating to that data. To run the app, download the ShinyFiles folder and then open server.r in rStudio. Download any packages that are used in the server.r/ui.r files and then click Run App to run the app in your web browser.
